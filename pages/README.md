# Learning how to learn

## Web Project No1.

## Description

Learning how to learn is my 1st website project created during the Practicum100 Web Development course by Yandex.
The code is written in HTML and CSS using a [BEM methodology][bemmeth] and was made according the [SEO][seo] rules.

## Next steps

The project is far away from being finished and few improvements are planned in the near future:

- Adding different fonts
- Checking the code for cross-compatibility and adding all the necessary vendor prefixes
- Designing a form that allows users to submit a comment

Currently this list is short but I'm planning add more tasks for this list later.
